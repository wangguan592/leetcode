"""

Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

For example, given
s = "leetcode",
dict = ["leet", "code"].

Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

UPDATE (2017/1/4):
The wordDict parameter had been changed to a list of strings (instead of a set of strings). Please reload the code definition to get the latest changes.

注意的情况："aaaaaaa"  ["aaaa","aaa"]
The idea is the following:

d is an array that contains booleans

d[i] is True if there is a word in the dictionary that ends at ith index of s AND d is also True at the beginning of the word

Example:

s = "leetcode"

words = ["leet", "code"]

d[3] is True because there is "leet" in the dictionary that ends at 3rd index of "leetcode"

d[7] is True because there is "code" in the dictionary that ends at the 7th index of "leetcode" AND d[3] is True
